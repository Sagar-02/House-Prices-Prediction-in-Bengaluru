Predicting House Prices in Bengaluru

Overview
This project aims to understand the key factors influencing home buyers in Bengaluru and develop a predictive model for housing prices. With the dynamic real estate landscape impacted by economic changes and regulations like RERA, our goal is to provide insights into property valuation in the Silicon Valley of India.

Key Considerations
Potential home buyers often evaluate a range of factors before making a purchase:

Location: Proximity to offices, schools, parks, restaurants, and healthcare facilities.
Size: The number of bedrooms and overall square footage.
Price: Affordability amidst fluctuating market trends.
Background
In 2017, Bengaluru saw a significant drop in housing sales by 7%, with property prices falling nearly 5% in the latter half of the year (Knight Frank). Our dataset includes over 9,000 apartment projects within various budget ranges, highlighting the challenges buyers face.

Data Description
Our dataset has been curated through extensive primary and secondary research, containing 9 features relevant to property valuation:

Area_type: Type of locality
Availability: Possession timeline (categorical and time-series)
Location: Specific area within Bengaluru
Price: Property value in lakhs (INR)
Size: Number of bedrooms (BHK)
Society: Name of the housing society
Total_sqft: Area in square feet
Bath: Number of bathrooms
Balcony: Number of balconies
Problem Statement
Using the provided features, our objective is to build a predictive model to estimate housing prices in Bengaluru, enabling potential buyers to make informed decisions.
